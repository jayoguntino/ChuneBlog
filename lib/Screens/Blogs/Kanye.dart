                          '''Kanye took his time releasing the album hosting a total of 3 album listening parties and ironically the album was finally released without his permission by his label Universal. Kanye took to Instagram to express his frustration.

Following his last studio album Jesus is King Kanye came back around with his 8th studio album titled â€˜DONDAâ€™.

The album is 21 tracks long and has an interesting range of sounds and percussions definitely a step in a different direction production wise from JIK. The album is still very spiritually themed with many references to the man upstairs.

Remote control [Track No.12] illustrates Gods power with a metaphor illustrating how the control of the worldâ€™s done via remote control gives me habbo hotel vibes if you know what I mean. Brings a sense of peace if you believe in a higher power right? The next seconds of your life planned out & the secs after thatâ€¦


Now Mr. West has always been able to hold a note and he uses his voice well throughout the whole album this album really does showcase his vocal range tho itâ€™s like autochune on steroids. *pun unapologetically added* 

Jail [Track 2] is a great example of this. We hope you listen to the albums you listen to off shuffle tho ðŸ¤¨


Praise God [Track 6] ft Tavis Scott & Baby Keem a duo you may have already heard of on â€˜durag activityâ€™ the simple yet catchy lines by all three artists make this track real easy to listen to. Baby keems verse as repetitive as it may be must go off in the speakers of car.

The album also has a romantic feel to it as the fts are not credited on any of the songs so for you hip-hop fans out there itâ€™s an enjoyable experience trying to figure out who all of the artists vocals are thereâ€™s a couple spoilers in this blog already however thereâ€™s still a few stars on the tape we havenâ€™t mentioned yet that Iâ€™m sure will interest you as you listen 


Weâ€™d love to hear what you think of the album & what youâ€™re favourite track from the album is? #EmailUs
